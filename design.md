Design Overview

    Background & Layout:
        Use Soft White (#FAFAFA) for the background to create a clean, neutral environment that doesn't distract from the content.
        Use Light Gray (#D3D3D3) for borders and sections to differentiate different parts of the page (e.g., input box, chat area, or navigation).

    Primary Section (Chat Area):
        The main area where users interact with the PDF should have a slightly darker background (either soft Light Gray (#D3D3D3) or a white background) with rounded corners for a smooth, modern look.
        Text in this area should be dark gray for easy reading, possibly Sea Green (#2E8B57) for user messages and Sky Blue (#87CEEB) for the system-generated messages, representing calmness and clarity.

    Text and Buttons:
        Emerald Green (#50C878) for primary actionable buttons (e.g., "Submit", "Ask", "Show Report").
        Coral Red (#FF6F61) for warnings and errors (e.g., "Invalid Input" or "Error Loading Report").
        Links or clickable text could use Sky Blue (#87CEEB) to maintain a consistent theme.

    User Interaction Area:
        The user message area should have input fields or text areas with a soft white background, light gray border, and rounded corners to keep the form input feel clean.
        Sky Blue (#87CEEB) can be used for placeholders or instructions within the input fields to maintain the theme and avoid visual clutter.
        For active user interaction, highlight the active text field with a subtle Sea Green (#2E8B57) border or background shade.

    PDF Viewing Area:
        Since the user is interacting with clinical reports, ensure the PDF viewer area uses Soft White (#FAFAFA) for backgrounds, with a Light Gray (#D3D3D3) border around the document area for clear separation from the chat functionality.
        Headers within the PDF viewer can be accentuated in Sky Blue (#87CEEB) to match the overall healthcare theme.

    Typography:
        Use clean and readable fonts like Helvetica or Arial for readability.
        Main headings can use Sea Green (#2E8B57), while secondary text can be in Dark Gray to provide enough contrast against the background.
        Emerald Green (#50C878) for highlighted or clickable items.
